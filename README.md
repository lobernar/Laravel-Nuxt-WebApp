# Laravel Angular Web Application

The goal of this personal project is to build a full-stack industrial performance dashboard using Laravel, Angular, and C# microservices.
This project allows me to explore a modern, enterprise-grade architecture that integrates multiple technologies.
I want to demonstrate my ability to design and implement complex, distributed applications from scratch â€” learning everything independently, without prior experience in these specific frameworks.

## What frameworks, concepts and tools did I learn?

Here is a non-exhaustive list of everything I am learning during this project:
- Laravel (PHP back-end framework for API development and database management)
- Angular (Front-end framework for building interactive, component-based dashboards)
- C# Microservices (Lightweight services for handling background processes and real-time data streaming)
- PostgreSQL (Relational database system for structured industrial performance data)
- RESTful APIs (Standard communication pattern between services and front-end)

## How to run

1. Start the backend from root folder\
    `php artisan serve`\
    The API will run at http://localhost:8000

2. Navigate to client/ folder\
    `npm install`\
    `ng serve`\
    Visit http://localhost:4200

3. Access the application\
    Once all services are running, open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:4200`
